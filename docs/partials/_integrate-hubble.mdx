  Now that you have your Hubble Network API Key, you can move on to integrating Hubble Network's
  BLE Connectivity into your devices. This diagram illustrates the flow for setting up secure BLE communication via Hubble.

It all starts with registering your device on Hubble Networkâ€™s Developer Portal. Once your device is registered, it will receive an `authToken` that is essential for secure BLE communication. This token enables your device to authenticate and exchange data with the Hubble Network BLE Network.

Let's dive into further details.

### Register Your Device

Register your device using the [Register Device API](/api#/operations/register_device) or through the Developer Portal. This API call returns a unique identifier for your device, which you will use in subsequent BLE operations.

Devices can be registered in advance or as needed, providing flexibility for your deployment.

### Establish Connection

After registering your device, establish a secure connection by invoking the [Add Device API](/api#/operations/add_device). This call provisions your device with the necessary credentials and pairs it with your organization's BLE network.

On successful registration, your device will receive an authorization token (`token`). Your server controls when to distribute this token, and your device (client side) uses the `token` to securely connect and communicate over the Hubble BLE Network.

### What's Next?

Once your device is set up, proceed to configure your client settings or explore more of Hubble Network's [REST APIs](/api/) for managing BLE connectivity.
