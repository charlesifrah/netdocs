## Basic Concepts

This section introduces the key concepts and terminology used in Hubble Network's BLE Connectivity system.

<details>
  <summary>
    **Organization**
  </summary>
In Hubble Network, the organization is the top-level entity where your BLE devices and configurations are managed. Every device that connects to the Hubble BLE network is registered under an organization. Your API keys, security settings, and profiles are tied to your organization, making it the central administrative unit.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    **Device**
  </summary>
A device in Hubble Network's BLE Connectivity system refers to any Bluetooth-enabled hardware (such as sensors, wearables, or embedded modules) that connects to the network. Devices register with an organization and exchange data via BLE advertisement packets, enabling seamless communication across low-power environments.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    **Connection Session**
  </summary>
A connection session represents a continuous period during which a device is actively connected to the Hubble Network BLE network. When a device disconnects and later reconnects, a new session is created. Sessions help track device activity and data transmission over time.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    **Configuration Profile**
  </summary>
A configuration profile defines a set of parameters that control how a device communicates on the Hubble Network BLE network. This includes settings for encryption, advertisement data, connection intervals, and other BLE-specific options. Profiles enable you to customize device behavior and optimize performance based on your use case.

To create or update a profile, please refer to our [Developer Portalâ€™s Configuration Section](https://dev.hubblenetwork.com/profiles).

## Components

Now that you are familiar with the terminology, let's review how the Hubble Network BLE Connectivity system is composed:

### Developer Portal

Access the [Developer Portal](https://dev.hubblenetwork.com/dashboard) to manage your organization, API keys, device registrations, and configuration profiles.

### REST API

Hubble Network's REST APIs allow your server to manage device registrations, connection sessions, configuration profiles, and more. They provide a programmatic interface for orchestrating BLE connectivity and monitoring device activity.

### BLE SDK

The BLE SDK provides client-side libraries and tools to integrate BLE functionality into your devices. It handles tasks such as advertisement generation, encryption key management, and secure communication protocols, streamlining the development process.
