# Architecture

The SDK architecture is built on modularity and extensibility, accommodating a broad range of implementation requirements. The following sections summarize its primary components:

## Services Layer: 
The Services Layer contains the core functionality of the SDK, including the satellite and BLE network modules. Applications interface with the SDK through this layer, leveraging a high-level API that streamlines satellite and BLE communication.

### Satellite Module: 
Provides APIs to transmit data to the Hubble Network. Because satellite communication relies on HubbleNetwork, this module assumes ownership of the target radio and possibly other devices when in use.

### BLE Network Module:
Offers APIs to generate Bluetooth advertisement packets, enabling connections to the Hubble BLE Network. This module uses the standard Bluetooth protocol and does not assume ownership of any hardware. The application is responsible for managing the Bluetooth stack.

## Port Layer: 
The Port Layer acts as an abstraction between the Services Layer and RTOS-specific implementations. It defines an API that simplifies porting the SDK to various RTOS environments beyond those natively supported.
