# Zephyr Quick Start

HubbleNetwork can be added to the manifest of an existing Zephyr project or function as the manifest repository. The following sections describe each approach.

## Adding Hubble Network to Zephyr

This procedure explains how to add Hubble Network to an existing Zephyr project or start a new project with Zephyr as the manifest repository.

1. **Set Up Your Zephyr Project:**  
   For new projects, refer to the Zephyr Getting Started Guide to set up your environment.

2. **Integrate HubbleNetwork SDK:**  
   After creating or selecting a Zephyr project, pull the SDK into your Zephyr workspace. Adjust your West sub-manifest (or create a new one) by including the snippet below:
   ```yaml
   manifest:
     remotes:
       - name: hubble
         url-base: https://github.com/HubbleNetwork
     projects:
       - name: hubblenetwork-sdk
         revision: main
         path: modules/lib/hubblenetwork-sdk
         remote: hubble
         groups:
           - optional

3. **Update the Project Configuration:**
    Run the following command to update the project:
    ```bash
    west update hubblenetwork-sdk
    ```
4. **Enable the Required Modules:**
    Add the following lines to your projectâ€™s prj.conf file:
    ```bash
    CONFIG_HUBBLE_BLE_NETWORK=y
    ```
    ```bash
    CONFIG_HUBBLE_NETWORK=y
    ```
    Use CONFIG_HUBBLE_BLE_NETWORK=y to enable the BLE network module or CONFIG_HUBBLE_NETWORK=y for the satellite network module.

## Using HubbleNetwork as the Manifest Repository
Alternatively, HubbleNetwork can serve as the manifest repository. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a Python Virtual Environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv ~/hubblenetwork-workspace/.venv
    ```
2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    source ~/hubblenetwork-workspace/.venv/bin/activate
    ```
    Once activated the shell will be prefixed with (.venv). Deactivate at any time by running deactivate. Re-activation is necessary whenever returning to work in this environment.

3. **Install West:**
    ```bash
    pip install west
    ```
4. **Obtain the Zephyr Source Code:**
    ```bash
    west init -m git@github.com:HubbleNetwork/hubblenetwork-sdk.git ~/hubblenetwork-workspace
    cd ~/hubblenetwork-workspace/modules/lib/hubblenetwork-sdk
    west update
    ```
5. **Export Zephyr:**
    ```bash
    west zephyr-export
    ```
    This command exports a Zephyr CMake package, allowing CMake to automatically load the required boilerplate code.
6. **Install Python Dependencies:**
  ```bash
  west packages pip --install
  pip install -r ~/hubblenetwork-workspace/zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt
  ```

## Building and Running the First Application
Once the integration is complete, you can build and flash a BLE network application:
1. **Build the Application:**
  ```bash
  cd ~/hubblenetwork-workspace/
  west build -p -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 modules/lib/hubblenetwork-sdk/samples/zephyr/ble-network
  ```
2. **Flash the Application:**
  ```bash
  west flash
  ```
