# Introduction

The Hubble Network SDK is designed with flexibility and scalability in mind. At its core, the SDK provides two primary functionalities—Satellite Communication and BLE Network Communication—both built around a modular architecture. This approach enables straightforward extensions or adaptations for various environments, including different real-time operating systems (RTOSes).

The diagram below illustrates the role of the Hubble Network SDK within an embedded application:
